# Sorting and Filtering Movies - Code Challenge

## Overview

In this coding challenge, your task is to implement several sorting comparators and a filtering function for a list of movies. You will be working with JavaScript to create these functions.

## Challenge Details

### Part 1 - Sorting Functions

You need to implement two sorting functions:

#### `sortYear`

- **Arguments**: `movies` (an array of movie objects)
- **Task**: Sort the input array `movies` by the release year in ascending order.

#### `sortTitle`

- **Arguments**: `movies` (an array of movie objects)
- **Task**: Sort the input array `movies` by movie titles. Ignore any leading `"The "` at the beginning of titles during sorting.

### Part 2 - Refactoring and Testing

In this part, you'll refactor your sorting functions and create stand-alone comparator callback functions. Export these callback functions and import them into a testing script (`test.js`). Write comprehensive tests for each sorting function to ensure their correctness.

## Example

Please refer to the provided `tests.ts` for an example of how your sorting functions should behave.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this challenge:

1. Write additional unit tests to validate your sorting functions.
2. Format your code and documentation according to standard practices.
3. Follow the provided template for a well-structured README.
4. Submit your solution as instructed in the submission guidelines.
